## Overview

This library provides a basic implementation of a GAN using TensorFlow's C++ API. It's designed to serve as a starting point for those looking to experiment with GANs in C++.

## Prerequisites

- TensorFlow (built from source to access C++ headers and libraries)
- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- (Any other dependencies or system requirements)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
   ```

2. **Build the project**: Provide build instructions, e.g., using CMake or Makefile.

3. **Install the library**: If necessary.

## Usage

1. **Training the GAN**:
   ```cpp
   GAN gan;
   gan.train();
   ```

2. **Generating Samples**:
   ```cpp
   Tensor noise = ...; // Create a noise tensor
   Tensor samples = gan.generate(noise);
   ```

3. For more detailed usage, refer to the provided examples in the `examples/` directory.
