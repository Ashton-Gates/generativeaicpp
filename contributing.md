## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [TensorFlow C++ GAN Library Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Issues

Issues are created when a potential problem is identified or when a new feature is proposed. Before creating a new issue, please ensure one doesn't already exist that matches your problem or enhancement.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Guidelines

- Ensure all code is properly commented and adheres to the project's coding style.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Keep pull requests concise, and only encompass one feature or bug fix.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname/issues/new).

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements or new features are always welcome! Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through the `beginner` and `help-wanted` tags in the issues.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Code Styleguide

- Use spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
